# COMP442-Natural-Language-Processing
# COURSE DESCRIPTION
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that is
concerned with modeling computers to understand, generate and interact with natural/human
language. This course will cover fundamental NLP tasks such as language modeling,
parsing, and dialogue, as well as modern-day models to solve these tasks. This is an
introductory, graduate-level course aimed at students willing to contribute to the NLP
literature in the near future. The main programming language will be Python, and we will
heavily depend on popular deep learning and NLP frameworks, e.g., Pytorch, Numpy, and
HF.
# COURSE OBJECTIVES
● To understand the foundational tasks and models for modern NLP,
● To prepare students to conduct high-quality research in NLP,
● To have students develop design and programming skills to solve practical NLP
problems,
● To emphasize the challenges and open problems in NLP
# COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
● Understand fundamental NLP tasks such as morphological, syntactic, semantic,
discourse analysis/parsing; language modeling; question answering; natural language
generation; dialogue
● Understand the full NLP pipeline such as data collection, annotation, fundamental text
data preprocessing, model implementation, development, and test
● Understand and be able to develop fundamental NLP models such as RNNs,
attention mechanisms, and transformer-based language models,
● Understand and get familiar with more recent NLP techniques such as in-context
learning
